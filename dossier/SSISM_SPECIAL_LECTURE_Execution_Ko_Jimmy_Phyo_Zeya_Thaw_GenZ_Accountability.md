> **SSISM Teaching Premise**  
> *When courts fail, education becomes the archive.  
> When power kills, memory becomes jurisdiction.*

## 📌 Purpose of This Training

This special lecture translates the **SSISM Constitutional Accountability Dossier** on the execution of **Ko Jimmy** and **Phyo Zeya Thaw** into a **training format** for:

- Gen Z learners  
- Civic educators  
- Documentation teams  
- Legal literacy circles  
- Memory preservation cells  

It teaches **how to think**, not **what to chant**.

No tactics.  
No violence.  
No incitement.  

Only **law, record, and responsibility**.

---

## 🧭 Learning Outcomes

Participants will be able to:

- Understand why the executions represent a **constitutional rupture**, not isolated cruelty  
- Explain how the 2008 Constitution was violated at every logical gate  
- Distinguish **power** from **law**  
- Understand why accountability has shifted structurally to **Gen Z**  
- Preserve evidence, memory, and legal framing safely

## 🧩 Core Concept: Downstream Crime

### Key Teaching Insight

The executions were **not the crime’s beginning**.  
They were the **end-point** of an illegal system.

> **SSISM Rule:**  
> If the foundation is unconstitutional, all downstream acts inherit illegality.

This lecture trains learners to **trace crimes backward**, not emotionally react forward.

## 🏛️ Module 1 — What Makes a State Lawful?

### Teaching Focus
- Constitutions limit power — even when written by authoritarians
- Emergency powers are **conditional**, not absolute
- Guardianship ≠ ownership of the state

### Myanmar Application
- Article 417 requires *real* threats to sovereignty
- Elections are legitimate inputs under the Constitution
- The military violated its own designed constraints

---

## ⚠️ Module 2 — The Coup as a Legal Failure (Not a Political Opinion)

### Teach Learners to Ask:
- Who had authority to declare emergency?
- Were procedures followed?
- Was judicial review possible?
- Were detentions lawful?

### SSISM Finding
The coup fails **before ideology**, **before politics**, and **before morality** —  
it fails **procedurally**.

---

## ⚖️ Module 3 — Treason: Reading the Law Against Power

### Critical Lesson
Treason is defined by **acts**, not uniforms.

Under Myanmar law:
- Overthrowing lawful authority
- Usurping sovereignty
- Governing through force

These criteria apply **regardless of rank**.

> **Teaching Rule:**  
> Never ask *who* committed the act.  
> Ask *whether the elements are met*.

---

## 🩸 Module 4 — Capital Punishment and Moral Collapse

### Dual Reality
- The death penalty exists in law
- Its use by an illegitimate regime destroys moral authority

### Teaching Boundary
This module does **not** advocate punishment.  
It teaches **why executions erase legitimacy**.

Learners must understand:
- Legal availability ≠ ethical legitimacy
- Abuse poisons future justice

---

## 🧱 Module 5 — Why Justice Is Blocked (For Now)

### Structural Barriers
- Captured courts
- Armed conflict
- Coercive immunity

### Key Insight
Justice is not absent.  
It is **queued**.

> **SSISM Principle:**  
> Accountability is delayed, fragmented, and asymmetric — but legally unavoidable.

---

## 🌍 Module 6 — International Law as External Memory

Learners are introduced to:
- Universal jurisdiction
- Crimes against humanity
- Hybrid tribunals

Without legal jargon overload.

Core idea:
> Domestic impunity creates **external liability**.

---

## 🧠 Module 7 — Gen Z as Custodians of Justice

### This Is the Heart of the Lecture

Gen Z’s role is **not revenge**.  
It is **record-keeping**.

Functions include:
- Preserving documents
- Safeguarding narratives
- Maintaining legal framing
- Resisting normalization of atrocity

> **SSISM Doctrine:**  
> Power governs the present.  
> Records govern the future.

---

## 🛡️ Safety & Ethical Boundary

This training explicitly forbids:
- Operational planning
- Violence advocacy
- Naming targets
- Tactical coordination

It explicitly promotes:
- Documentation
- Education
- Preservation
- Civilian protection

---

## ✅ Final Teaching Synthesis

- The executions fixed liability in history
- Law failed institutionally, not intellectually
- Justice is now a **process**, not an event
- Gen Z holds the archive, not the gun

🎓 *A regime can erase lives.  
It cannot erase a verified record.*
