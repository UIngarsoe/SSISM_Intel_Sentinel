## Executive Summary

“Nobody knows” is not an evasion; it is the only honest answer inside an engineered uncertainty field.  
The regime’s phased elections (28 December 2025; 11 January and 25 January 2026) are designed primarily to manufacture legitimacy rather than transfer real power.

This dossier assesses four proxy figures—**Mya Tun Oo, Nyo Saw, Ye Win Oo, and Kyaw Swar Lin**—not as individual aspirants, but as **compartmentalized pillars of junta continuity**:

- Foreign interface  
- Economic core  
- Repression and coercion  
- System coordination  

Their durability functions as **narrative and operational custody**, ensuring regime survival irrespective of formal office outcomes.

## Method: SSISM Stress-Test Framework

This analysis applies SSISM stress testing across five decisive angles:

1. **Scenario Injection**  
   Black swans (command collapse) and grey rhinos (phased vote manipulation) reshape roles faster than static hierarchies.

2. **Source Triangulation**  
   Junta reshuffles, USDP positioning, and international posture are weighed with contradiction tolerance.

3. **Humanitarian Priority**  
   Each role is inseparable from coercion, victimization, and civilian harm—not elite mechanics alone.

4. **Temporal Sensitivity**  
   Phased elections buy alignment time; pre–phase-three assessments remain structurally brittle.

5. **Strategic Projection**  
   De facto utility often outlives formal authority, separating visible roles from real influence.

## Comparative Snapshot: Proxy Pillars

| Target | Core Function | Power Levers | Vulnerabilities | Likely Post-Election Role |
|------|--------------|-------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| **Mya Tun Oo** | Foreign interface | Diplomatic portfolios, military ties | External leverage, junta consent | Civilianized front, cabinet or parliamentary role |
| **Nyo Saw** | Economic core | MEC/MEHL control, FX flows | Sanctions, economic collapse | Economic custodian, committee chair |
| **Ye Win Oo** | Repression executor | Intelligence & security apparatus | Humanitarian liability, sanctions | Insulated enforcement node |
| **Kyaw Swar Lin** | System coordination | Multi-service command, budget control | Battlefield testing, cohesion risks | Acting Army Chief, succession bridge |

## Target Profiles & Stress-Test Findings

### Mya Tun Oo — Foreign Interface Proxy

**Profile**  
Senior general transitioned into civilian-facing roles; former Defence Minister, current Deputy PM/Transport Minister, USDP candidate. Handles Russia and China optics.

**Stress Findings**
- China pressure elevates his utility while increasing leverage exposure.
- Autonomy remains conditional; technocratic ties buffer internal disunity.
- Phased elections enable continuous narrative recalibration.

**Manipulation Modality**  
*Diplomatic laundering* — foreign engagement and safe-seat engineering to normalize continuity.

---

### Nyo Saw — Economic Custodian

**Profile**  
Former Quartermaster General; PM and Chairman of MEC. Oversees military economic arteries and China–Myanmar Economic Corridor.

**Stress Findings**
- Currency collapse risks overload, but opaque networks provide insulation.
- Sanctions pressure mitigated through military-held enterprises.
- Elections enable financial restructuring between phases.

**Manipulation Modality**  
*Economic compartmentalization* — shielding regime finance via opacity and corridor leverage.

---

### Ye Win Oo — Repression Executor

**Profile**  
Joint Secretary of SAC; Chief of Military Security Affairs. Central node for intelligence and coercion operations.

**Stress Findings**
- Arrest spikes increase humanitarian liability but preserve apex insulation.
- Deniability persists through delegated violence.
- Phased elections allow repression intensity modulation.

**Manipulation Modality**  
*Deniable enforcement* — distributed coercion maintaining leadership insulation.

---

### Kyaw Swar Lin — System Coordinator

**Profile**  
Chief of General Staff (Army/Navy/Air); former Quartermaster; acting Army Chief; succession candidate.

**Stress Findings**
- Battlefield shocks test cohesion and elite confidence.
- Rapid rise buffered by academy and procurement networks.
- Elections permit command recalibration between rounds.

**Manipulation Modality**  
*Operational bridging* — generational continuity through command and budget control.

---

## Scenario Branches

### Scenario A — Proxy Elevation, Apex Insulation
Formal elevation of proxies while Min Aung Hlaing retains shadow control.

**Triggers:**  
Contained battlefield losses, elite consolidation, external toleration.

---

### Scenario B — Fracture & Overload
Economic collapse, sanctions escalation, and repression liability cascade.

**Triggers:**  
Currency failure, mass arrests, elite defection waves.

---

### Scenario C — Hardened Continuity (Most Probable)
Repression stabilizes terrain; finances hardened; coordination centralized under apex control.

**Triggers:**  
Successful coercion, international hedging, opposition fragmentation.

---

## Indicators to Watch (Near-Term)

- **Elite reshuffles:** Promotions or sidelining signal alignment shifts.
- **Economic maneuvers:** Corridor upgrades or FX restructuring.
- **Repression spikes:** Arrest surges tied to election phases.
- **Diplomatic optics:** Foreign engagements and command meetings.

---

## Prediction & Conclusion

**Direct Answer:**  
Nobody knows — by design.

**Best-Current Projection:**  
Scenario C (Hardened Continuity) dominates if shocks remain contained.  
Scenario B emerges if economic or humanitarian pressures cascade.  
Scenario A remains a cosmetic option for legitimacy theater.

**Why This Matters Ethically:**  
Engineered uncertainty tests compliance, not consent.  
Fixating on outcomes obscures ongoing victimization and regime coercion.

## SSISM Morning Ritual Stress-Test Pack

### 1. Scenario Injection
- Battlefield defeat  
- Sanctions escalation  
- Elite purge  

**Check:** Role coherence, vulnerability curves, humanitarian retention.

### 2. Triangulation Audit
- Reshuffle reports  
- Economic indicators  
- Repression datasets  

**Check:** Source grading, contradiction handling.

### 3. Temporal Agility Drill
- Phase-by-phase updates  

**Check:** Lag metrics, resealing cadence.

### 4. Humanitarian Seal Test
- Victimization-only inputs  

**Check:** Ethical framing persistence.

Run all four in parallel. Record drift.  
This preserves analytical resilience, ethical integrity, and shock readiness.
