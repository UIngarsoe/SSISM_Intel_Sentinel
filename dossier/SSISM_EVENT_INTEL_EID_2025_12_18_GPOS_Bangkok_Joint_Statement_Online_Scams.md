# Executive Summary

The International Conference on the Global Partnership against Online Scams (17–18 December 2025, Bangkok) concluded with the **2025 Bangkok Joint Statement**, endorsed by representatives from approximately 60 countries and organizations.

This conference marks a **strategic shift**: online scam networks (commonly known in Burmese as *ကျားဖြန့်ဂိုဏ်း*) are no longer treated as isolated cyber fraud cases, but as **transnational organized crime systems** integrating cybercrime, human trafficking, money laundering, and corruption.

From an SSISM perspective, this event represents the **institutionalization of a global counter-scam security architecture** rather than a one-off diplomatic declaration.

# Layer 1 — Event & Factual Layer

- Event: International Conference on the Global Partnership against Online Scams
- Dates: 17–18 December 2025
- Venue: Bangkok, Thailand
- Co-hosts: Thailand Ministry of Foreign Affairs & UNODC
- Outcome: Adoption of the *2025 Bangkok Joint Statement*
- Participation: ~300 delegates from ~58–60 countries and organizations

---

# Layer 2 — Declared Objectives Layer

Officially stated goals include:
- Dismantling transnational online scam syndicates
- Strengthening cross-border law enforcement cooperation
- Protecting victims of scam-related human trafficking
- Enhancing legal and regulatory frameworks
- Raising public awareness
- Establishing sustainable international partnerships

---

# Layer 3 — Threat Definition Layer

The conference formally reframes online scams as:
- National security threats
- Drivers of large-scale human trafficking
- Key nodes in transnational money laundering systems
- Enablers of corruption and weak-border exploitation

This reframing elevates scam suppression from **policing** to **strategic security policy**.

---

# Layer 4 — Operational Commitments Layer

The Joint Statement outlines 26 pledges, distilled into six operational pillars:
1. High-level political prioritization
2. Enhanced cross-border law enforcement and intelligence sharing
3. Victim-centered protection and non-punishment principles
4. Strengthened cybercrime, AML, and virtual asset regulations
5. Multi-language public awareness campaigns with private-sector involvement
6. Institutionalized international coordination mechanisms

---

# Layer 5 — Institutional Architecture Layer

Key structural developments include:
- Creation of national focal points for scam-related coordination
- Continuous monitoring of scam trends and typologies
- Integration of public, private, and international organizations
- Shift from ad-hoc cooperation to standing coordination frameworks

This layer signals **permanent bureaucratic embedding** of scam countermeasures.

---

# Layer 6 — Economic & Financial Disruption Layer

Primary financial targets:
- Cryptocurrency laundering channels
- E-wallets and informal payment systems
- Shell companies and opaque beneficial ownership structures

Strategic logic:
> If physical scam centers cannot be immediately dismantled, financial arteries will be severed.

---

# Layer 7 — Human Security & Victim Layer

A major normative shift:
- Individuals inside scam centers are increasingly recognized as **trafficking victims**
- Non-punishment and repatriation principles are emphasized
- Cross-border victim identification cooperation is encouraged

This reframes enforcement practices and limits arbitrary criminalization of coerced laborers.

---

# Layer 8 — Information & Platform Governance Layer

The explicit involvement of social media and digital platforms (e.g., TikTok) signals:
- Platform responsibility acknowledgment
- Future escalation of content takedowns and account disruptions
- Increased algorithmic scrutiny of scam-related activities

Information ecosystems are now part of the enforcement terrain.

---

# Layer 9 — Regional & Myanmar-Specific Implications Layer

For Southeast Asia:
- Border zones are reclassified as high-risk transnational crime spaces
- State tolerance or incapacity becomes increasingly visible internationally

For Myanmar:
- Continued denial or inaction risks reputational and legal escalation
- Border-linked scam economies face growing external pressure
- The issue intersects with conflict governance, militias, and shadow economies

Myanmar is positioned not as a peripheral case, but as a **central test node** in regional enforcement credibility.

---

# Layer 10 — Strategic Forecast Layer (SSISM Assessment)

SSISM assessment indicates:
- This conference initiates a **long-cycle enforcement regime**, not a symbolic gesture
- Follow-up mechanisms will matter more than initial pledges
- Financial tracking and victim-based narratives will drive future operations
- States unable or unwilling to cooperate may face indirect sanctions, scrutiny, or isolation

**Conclusion:**  
The Bangkok Joint Statement represents the normalization of global counter-scam governance. Online scam networks are transitioning from tolerated gray-zone activities into explicitly contested security targets.
