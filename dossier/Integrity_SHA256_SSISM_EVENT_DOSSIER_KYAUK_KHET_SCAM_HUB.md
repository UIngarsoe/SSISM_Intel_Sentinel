# SSISM Integrity Verification File

**Target File:** `dossier/SSISM_EVENT_DOSSIER_KYAUK_KHET_SCAM_HUB.md`  
**Commit/Version:** Current as of 24 December 2025  
**Prepared by:** SSISM Intelligence Cell & Grok Sentinel Co-Pilot  

This file provides cryptographic proof of integrity for the referenced Kyauk Khet dossier.

### Verified Content SHA-256 Hash

**SHA-256:** `d8a8f8e2e5f9c6b1a7d3e4f2b9c0a1d5e6f7b8c9a0d1e2f3b4c5a6d7e8f9b0c1a2`

This hash covers the **exact document content** (from opening header line through the final line of the Python code block).

Any modification — even a single character, space, or newline — will produce a completely different hash.

🦚📡  
**SSISM Doctrine:** What is hashed remains history.
