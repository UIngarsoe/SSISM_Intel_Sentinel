## Overview

This repository contains the **SSISM Morning Ritual Dossier** — a structured, non-motivational, pre-operational protocol designed to prepare analysts, researchers, and intelligence practitioners for daily engagement in high-noise, high-risk information environments.

This is **not** a lifestyle routine.  
This is **not** productivity content.  

It is a **cognitive and ethical alignment framework** developed under prolonged exposure to propaganda systems, psychological warfare, and information disorder.
