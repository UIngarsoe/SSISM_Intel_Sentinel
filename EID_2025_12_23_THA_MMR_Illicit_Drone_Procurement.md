# SSISM EVENT INTELLIGENCE DOSSIER  
## Illicit Drone Procurement, Cross-Border Militarisation, and Civilian Threat Escalation

---

## Executive Intelligence Assessment

SSISM confirms with **high confidence** that the Myanmar military (SAC/Tatmadaw) is actively engaged in **covert overseas procurement of military-capable drones**, using Thailand as a logistics and testing corridor.  

The December 2025 arrests near **Suvarnabhumi International Airport**—involving **four Myanmar nationals**, **ten Chinese-manufactured drones**, and prior **NBTC seizure of over 2,500 suspicious drone units**—constitute **direct operational evidence** of a military-linked acquisition pipeline.

Thai security authorities have **not linked the suspects to revolutionary or resistance forces**. Instead, interrogation records and logistics patterns indicate **state-aligned buyers supplying the Myanmar military**, with civilian areas inside Myanmar assessed as the primary operational targets.

## Incident Timeline (Condensed)

**Pre-23 Dec 2025**
- Thai NBTC detects anomalous drone flight signatures
- Over **2,500 suspicious drones** seized nationwide
- Drones assessed as similar to **Ukraine combat-modified models**

**23 Dec 2025**
- Lat Krabang Police raid hotel near Suvarnabhumi Airport
- **4 Myanmar nationals arrested**
- **10 DJI-type Chinese drones seized**
- Location assessed as a **drone control / testing node**

**Post-Arrest**
- Suspects state drones were to be delivered to a Myanmar handler (“Kevin Zo”)
- Final resale destination identified as **Myanmar military buyers**
- Visas revoked; suspects transferred to Immigration Bureau

---

## Attribution Assessment

### Why This Is NOT a Resistance Operation

- Thai authorities did **not** classify suspects as insurgents
- Operational testing occurred near **international aviation infrastructure**
- Use of **serial-traceable commercial platforms**
- Logistics flow moved **toward Myanmar military channels**, not border resistance routes

SSISM Attribution Conclusion:
> The operation aligns with **state-linked procurement behavior**, not revolutionary logistics.

---

## Drone Typology & Military Relevance

- Dual-use Chinese-manufactured platforms (DJI class)
- High payload potential
- Compatible with weaponized modification kits
- Telemetry and encryption extensible

NBTC reference to **“Ukrainian-model drones”** signals:
- Awareness of combat conversion patterns
- Recognition of military—not civilian—intent

---

## Strategic Intent Analysis

SSISM assesses the drones were intended for:

- Civilian area surveillance
- Psychological intimidation flights
- Precision harassment attacks
- Night operations over villages and IDP zones

This aligns with the Myanmar military’s **post-2024 aerial suppression doctrine**, emphasizing terror and deniability over battlefield engagement.

---

## Network Structure (Assessed)

1. **Procurement Agents** – Myanmar nationals abroad  
2. **Logistics Fixers** – Cross-border coordinators  
3. **Commercial Suppliers** – Grey-market exporters  
4. **Military End-Users** – Tatmadaw Air / Signals units  

Pattern mirrors:
- Sanctions evasion networks
- Surveillance technology trafficking
- Dual-use weapon conversion pipelines

---

## Regional Security Implications

- Thai airspace and airport security compromised
- ASEAN drone proliferation risk elevated
- Civil aviation safety threatened
- Cross-border militarisation normalized

---

## Legal & Policy Relevance

Potential violations include:
- Export control circumvention
- Aviation security laws
- Dual-use weapons trafficking norms
- International humanitarian law (civilian targeting risk)

This dossier supports:
- Expanded sanctions review
- Export oversight scrutiny
- Regional security coordination

---

## SSISM Confidence & Integrity Seal

**Confidence Level:** 🟢🟢🟢🟢⚪ (High)

✔ Multi-source corroboration  
✔ Official Thai security disclosures  
✔ Independent Burmese media confirmation  
✔ Pattern consistency with prior SAC behavior  

---

## Analytical Conclusion

The Suvarnabhumi drone case represents a **confirmed escalation** in Myanmar military strategy:  
**covert, cross-border drone acquisition to sustain civilian repression**.

This is not conjecture.  
It is **documented intelligence convergence**.
